-United States – Key tech and expanding manufacturing
- China – Large producer, especially older chips



How i can start
------------------------

I’ll assume you mean starting a small chip-design company or project, not building a factory.

1️⃣ How to start chip design (step-by-step)
🔹 Step 1: Learn the fundamentals (0–6 months)

If you already know some electronics, this can be faster.

You need:

Digital design (very important)

Logic gates, FSMs

Verilog / SystemVerilog

Computer architecture (basic CPU concepts)

VLSI basics

Timing, power, area

Linux basics (most tools run on Linux)

📚 What to learn first:

Verilog / SystemVerilog

Digital logic

Basic ASIC flow

⏱ Time: 3–6 months (self-study, daily practice)

🔹 Step 2: Practice with free tools (2–4 months)

You don’t need expensive tools at the beginning.

Free / open tools:

Verilator (simulation)

GTKWave (waveforms)

Yosys + OpenROAD (synthesis & place-and-route)

SkyWater 130 nm PDK (real fabrication process)

Your first goals:

Design a small IP block (UART, SPI, timer)

Simulate it

Run it through full RTL → GDS flow

⏱ Time: 2–4 months

🔹 Step 3: Build a real chip (prototype) (3–6 months)

This is where it gets exciting 😄

Options:

MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) via:

Google / SkyWater

Efabless

Cost: $0–$10k (can be free via programs)

What you can build:

Simple MCU

Accelerator (AI, crypto, DSP)

Sensor interface chip

⏱ Time:

Design + verification: 2–4 months

Fabrication: 6–12 weeks (foundry time)

🔹 Step 4: Turn it into a company (parallel process)

You don’t wait until the chip is done.

Do in parallel:

Register a company

Build a small team (2–5 engineers)

Talk to customers first

Decide: IP licensing or full chip sales

Revenue models:

IP licensing

Custom chip design for clients

Niche product (IoT, automotive, power, AI edge)

2️⃣ How long does it REALLY take?
⏳ Timeline summary (realistic)
Stage	Time
Learn basics	3–6 months
First serious design	2–4 months
First tape-out	3–6 months
First paying customer	12–24 months

👉 Total: ~1.5 to 2 years to make money
(Some do it faster, most take longer — totally normal.)

3️⃣ How much money is needed (rough idea)
Level	Cost
Learning + tools	$0–$500
First prototype	$0–$10k
Small startup (1–3 people)	$50k–$150k/year
VC-backed startup	$1M+

You can start very small.

4️⃣ Best first chip to design (don’t overreach)

Start with something boring but useful:

✅ UART / SPI controller
✅ Power management IC (if analog skills)
✅ Simple MCU
✅ Edge AI accelerator (very small)

Most startups fail because they try to build “next Nvidia” on day one.

5️⃣ One honest truth

Chip design is hard — but small chips are very doable.

Today is the best time ever to start because:

Free tools exist

MPW programs exist

Customers want custom silicon
